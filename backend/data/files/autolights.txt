Presence checker project
In developing the "Presence Checker Device," the project introduces an innovative solution utilizing Raspberry Pi, Python, LDR sensor, and lasers to monitor room occupancy. The "Presence Checker Device" operates by detecting changes in light levels through the LDR sensor, triggering a response when someone obstructs the lasers. Upon detection, the "Presence Checker Device" automatically activates the lights and pushes the corresponding data to a webhook.
The core functionality of the "Presence Checker Device" extends to energy efficiency. In instances of prolonged inactivity, defined as 15 minutes without detected presence, the "Presence Checker Device" intelligently turns off the lights and communicates this status to the webhook. This feature not only ensures resource conservation but also contributes to the project's sustainability.
The backend of the "Presence Checker Device" is predominantly Python-based, executing on the Raspberry Pi. This allows for seamless integration of the LDR sensor and laser components, orchestrating real-time responses to changes in the room's presence status. The webhook serves as the bridge for data transmission, pushing relevant information about room occupancy and light status.
Beyond the hardware and sensor functionalities, the "Presence Checker Device" project extends to data visualization on a website. Using Python and Streamlit, the "Presence Checker Device" website fetches data from the webhook, presenting it in an accessible and user-friendly format. This feature provides users with a comprehensive overview of room occupancy patterns, making the "Presence Checker Device" a valuable tool for monitoring and analysis.
