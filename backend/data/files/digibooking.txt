Digi Booking Project
Digi Booking, our innovative project, transforms the event management landscape by integrating cutting-edge machine learning, specifically relying on AWS Rekognition. In the user-friendly Digi Booking interface, individuals are prompted to submit a facial photo during the event booking process, setting the stage for advanced identity verification at event venues.
Behind the scenes, the robust facial recognition model of Digi Booking is powered by AWS Rekognition. This integration ensures precise and reliable identification, enhancing security measures for event entry. Notably, Digi Booking seamlessly incorporates AWS S3 for secure storage of facial images, utilizing the power and scalability of Amazon's cloud infrastructure for efficient data management.
The facial recognition model, driven by AWS Rekognition, is designed to handle unique scenarios, including potential challenges with twins booking the same event. This advanced capability adds an extra layer of sophistication to the identity validation process, reinforcing the reliability of the system.
Complementing the facial recognition process, Digi Booking employs AWS Rekognition for QR code generation and validation. Each user is assigned a unique QR code, offering an additional layer of security and a fail-safe mechanism for entry verification. AWS Rekognition's robust algorithms ensure the uniqueness and authenticity of each code, providing a reliable alternative in case facial recognition encounters challenges.
Data protection remains a top priority for Digi Booking. AWS S3, integral to the project, plays a crucial role in securely storing and managing facial images. Advanced ML techniques, coupled with AWS Rekognition, safeguard user privacy by dissociating facial images from owner identities during storage. Furthermore, the system is programmed to automatically remove facial data from the secure S3 storage post-verification, adhering to stringent privacy practices and preventing indefinite data retention.
Digi Booking's machine learning-driven approach extends beyond security measures to optimize event management processes. By leveraging AWS Rekognition, the project significantly enhances the efficiency of entry procedures, particularly in high-gathering events. The system mitigates the risk of stampedes by minimizing queues through expedited verification, making Digi Booking a transformative solution for various events and venues. The seamless integration of AWS Rekognition and S3 is a key factor in ensuring a secure, efficient, and user-friendly event booking experience with Digi Booking.
On the backend, Digi Booking employs a robust tech stack, utilizing Node.js and Express for server-side development. File uploading is seamlessly managed through Multer, ensuring smooth integration of user-submitted facial photos into the system. AWS SDK is instrumental in connecting Digi Booking to the power of Amazon's cloud infrastructure, with MongoDB serving as the database to efficiently store and retrieve data, ensuring a scalable and responsive backend architecture.
The frontend of Digi Booking is powered by React, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface. Tailwind CSS enhances the aesthetic appeal and responsiveness of the frontend, providing a sleek and modern design for users interacting with the platform. Additionally, TensorFlow.js, a versatile JavaScript library for machine learning in the browser, is integrated into the frontend, contributing to the seamless execution of machine learning processes such as facial recognition.
Notably, Digi Booking extends its reach to the mobile domain through a dedicated app developed using WebApp for Swift. This mobile application ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience for iOS users, providing them with the convenience of accessing and managing their event bookings on the go.
The harmonious integration of Node.js, Express, Multer, AWS SDK, MongoDB, React, Tailwind CSS, TensorFlow.js, and WebApp for Swift creates a comprehensive and cutting-edge technological foundation for Digi Booking. This tech stack not only ensures the security and efficiency of the facial recognition system but also contributes to the seamless user experience across both web and mobile platforms.
